# Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaueMarques/kaueMarques/master/hi.gif" width="30px">, I'm Iago CÃ©sar

I found in software development ðŸ’» the pure emotion of being able to solve problems that I never thought would exist, simply because I could see the customer's satisfaction and surprise when he saw that his need was met and the content developed went beyond his expectations.
Because of that, I can say that I love what I do, and I do it with love ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ.

## Ho am I ?

When I turned 10, I had my first experience with a computer, when I was awarded, through a random selection, to take computer classes. I managed to complete the course with excellent grades, and my parents managed to save some money to buy our first computer.

It wasn't a very good device, but it was enough for me to apply what I had learned in computer classes. I was always very curious and self-taught, so I used that machine to learn new things.

In my first job, at the age of 14, I also had contact with a computer, and there was a specialized system for that company. I saw how the solution met everyone's needs and I thought it was incredible. The experience I got thanks to the classes I took made things a lot easier, and I was soon helping laypeople to use their computers in the company.

In my third job I started my experience in an IT department, precisely offering support to the users of this other company. I improved my knowledge a lot and I was also able to know what a programmer's job was, albeit superficially. When I found out how systems were made I knew it was what I would like to do for the rest of my life.

I enrolled in a college in my region and pursued higher education. Before I even finished, I was invited by my Database and Computer Networks teacher to do a job interview to join the development team. I was approved and that teacher also became my manager.

That's how I became a systems developer, and since then I've been able to improve my technique a lot. I see this through the feedbacks I get from users of the solutions I developed.

Now I have a new goal, which is to become an excellent developer for web application.
